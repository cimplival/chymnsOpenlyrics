    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I danced in the morning <br/>when the world was begun<br/>I danced in the Moon, <br/>and the stars, and the Sun<br/>I came down from Heaven <br/>and I danced on Earth<br/>At Bethlehem I had my birth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Dance then, wherever <br/>you may be<br/>I am the Lord of the Dance,<br/>said He!<br/>And I'll lead you all, <br/>wherever you may be<br/>And I'll lead you all <br/>in the Dance, said He!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I danced for the scribe <br/>and the pharisee<br/>They would not dance, <br/>they wouldn't follow me<br/>So I danced for the fishermen <br/>James and John<br/>They come with me and<br/> the Dance went on:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I danced on the Sabbath <br/>and cured the lame<br/>The holy people, they <br/>said it was a shame!<br/>They whipped and stripped <br/>and then hung me high<br/>Left me there on a cross to die!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I danced on a Friday when<br/> the sky turned black<br/>It's hard to dance with the<br/>devil on your back<br/>They buried my body and<br/> they thought I'd gone<br/>But I am the Dance <br/>and I still go on!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>They cut me down <br/>but I leap up high<br/>I am the Life that will <br/>never never die!<br/>I live in you if you <br/>live in Me<br/>I am the Lord of<br/> the Dance, said He!</lines>
