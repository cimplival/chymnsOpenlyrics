      <lines>Today bring to me those<br/>who do not believe in God<br/>and those who do not <br/>yet know me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I was thinking also of them<br/>during My bitter Passion,<br/>and their future zeal <br/>comforted my heart.<br/>Immerse them in the ocean<br/>of my Mercy. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Most compassionate Jesus, <br/>Your are the light of the<br/>whole world.<br/>Receive into the abode of <br/>your most compassionate heart<br/>the souls of those who as yet <br/>do not believe in you <br/>or do not know you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Let the rays of your grace<br/>enlighten them that they, too,<br/>together with us, <br/>may extol your wonderful mercy,<br/>and do not let them escape from<br/>the abode which is your<br/>most compassionate heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5a">
      <lines>Eternal Father, <br/>turn your merciful gaze <br/>upon the souls of those who <br/>do not believe in your Son,<br/>and of those who as yet<br/>do not know you,<br/>but who are enclosed in the<br/>most compassionate heart <br/>of Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5b">
      <lines>Draw them to the light<br/>of the Gospel.<br/>These souls do not know what<br/>great happiness it is to <br/>love you. <br/>Grant that they too,<br/>mau extol the generosity of<br/>your mercy for endless ages.<br/>Amen.</lines>
