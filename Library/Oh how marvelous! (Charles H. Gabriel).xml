    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand amazed in the presence<br/>of Jesus the Nazarene,<br/>and wonder how <br/>he could love me,<br/>a sinner, condemned, unclean. </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh, how marvelous! <br/>Oh, how wonderful!<br/>And my song shall ever be:<br/>Oh, how marvelous! <br/>Oh, how wonderful!<br/>Is my Savior’s love for me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For me it was in the garden<br/>he prayed: <br/>“Not my will, but Thine.”<br/>He had no tears <br/>for his own griefs,<br/>but sweat drops of blood <br/>for mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In pity angels beheld him,<br/>and came from <br/>the world of light<br/>to comfort him in the sorrows<br/>he bore for my soul that night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He took my sins <br/>and my sorrows,<br/>he made them his very own;<br/>he bore the burden <br/>to Calv’ry,<br/>and suffered and died alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When with the <br/>ransomed in glory<br/>his face I at last shall see,<br/>’Twill be my joy<br/>through the ages<br/>to sing of his love for me.</lines>
