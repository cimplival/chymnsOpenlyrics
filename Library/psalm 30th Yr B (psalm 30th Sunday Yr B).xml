    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What great deeds the Lord worked for us!<br/>Indeed, we were glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the Lord brought back the exiles of Sion,<br/>we thought we were dreaming.<br/>Then was our mouth filled with laughter;<br/>on our tongues, songs of joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then the nations themselves said, "What great deeds<br/>the Lord worked for them!"<br/>What great deeds the Lord worked for us!<br/>Indeed, we were glad.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Bring back our exiles, O Lord,<br/>as streams in the south.<br/>Those who are sowing in tears;<br/>will sing when they reap.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>They go out, they go out, full of tears,<br/>Bearing seeds for the sowing;<br/>they come back, they come back with a song,<br/>bearing their sheaves.</lines>
