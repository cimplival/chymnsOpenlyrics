    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My faith has found a<br/>resting place,<br/>Not in device nor creed.<br/>I trust the ever living one,<br/>his wounds for me <br/>shall plead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I need no other argument,<br/>I need no other plea.<br/>It is enough that Jesus died,<br/>and that he died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Enough for me that Jesus saves,<br/>this ends my fear and doubt.<br/>A sinful soul I come to him,<br/>he'll never cast me out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My heart is leaning on the word,<br/>the written word of God.<br/>Salvation by my Savior's name,<br/>salvation through his blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My great physician <br/>heals the sick,<br/>the lost he came to save.<br/>For me his precious blood<br/>he shed, for me <br/>his life he gave.</lines>
