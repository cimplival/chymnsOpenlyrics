    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Whatsoever you do<br/>to the least of my brothers,<br/>that you do unto me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I was hungry, <br/>you gave me to eat;<br/>When I was thirsty, <br/>you gave me to drink. <br/>Now enter into the home <br/>of my Father.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was homeless, <br/>you opened your door;<br/>When I was naked, <br/>you gave me your coat.<br/>Now enter into the home <br/>of my Father.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I was weary, <br/>you helped me find rest;<br/>When I was anxious, <br/>you calmed all my fears.<br/>Now enter into the home <br/>of my Father.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When in a prison, <br/>you came to my cell;<br/>When on a sickbed, <br/>you cared for my needs.<br/>Now enter into the home<br/> of my Father.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When I was aged <br/>you bothered to smile;<br/>When I was restless<br/>you listened and cared,<br/>Now enter int o the home <br/>of my Father.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>When I was laughed at, <br/>you stood by my side;<br/>When I was happy, <br/>you shared in my joy.<br/>Now enter into the home <br/>of my Father.</lines>
