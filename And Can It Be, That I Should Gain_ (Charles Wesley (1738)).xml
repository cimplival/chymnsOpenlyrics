    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And can it be that I should gain <br/>an interest in the Saviour's blood?<br/>Died He for me, who caused His pain;<br/>for me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>Amazing love! how can it be,<br/>That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Amazing love! how can it be,<br/>That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?<br/>Amazing love! how can it be,<br/>That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He left His Father's throne above<br/>so free so infinite His grace -<br/>Emptied Himself of all but love;<br/>And bled for Adam's helpless race;<br/>'Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>O praise my God, it reaches me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No condemnation now I dread;<br/>Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br/>Alive in Him, my living Head;<br/>And clothed in righteousness divine;<br/>Bold I approach th'eternal throne;<br/>And claim the crown, through Christ <br/>my own.</lines>
